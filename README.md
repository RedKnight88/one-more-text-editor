# One More Text Editor

## Description
In another right of passage as a programmer, I have made one more text editor to add onto the decades old pile. This Progressive Web Application utilizes Webpack alongside Node to create Service Workers to implement caching, Indexed DB storage, and other plugins to bundle the frontend client data for the application. Website load speeds are essential, and this exercise flexed the muscles to practice technologies that provide speedy loads. It's nothing too drastic or impressive, but still was complicated, and I'm glad it was seen to completion.

Type away! The site will store any code snippets you'd like to share or come back to later.
